```bash
cp .env.example .env
composer install
npm install

## Game Flow

1. **Pregame** — Admin opens auth, players register and complete their profile
2. **Running** — Admin assigns targets; players hunt their target and submit kills
3. **Kill approval** — Victim approves or contests the kill; admin resolves disputes
4. **Inheritance** — On approved kill, killer inherits victim's target
5. **Postgame** — Game ends; leaderboard shows final standings
